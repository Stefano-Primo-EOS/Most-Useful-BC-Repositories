## Microsoft

### **[AL](https://github.com/microsoft/AL)**
The main purpose of this repository is to track issues regarding the latest version of the AL compiler and developer tools available in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or as part of the AL Developer Preview builds for Dynamics 365 Business Central. In addition, you will find code samples to help you get started writing extensions in AL and get familiar with the tools.

### **[AL App Extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions)**
Welcome to the ALAppExtension repository!

This repo is a platform for Microsoft and our vibrant partner channel and community to work together to develop system modules and add-on apps in the AL language and to enable the general extensibility of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

We’re working to make the core application thinner, more extensible, and easier to localize by extracting more and more of our system logic into modules, forming a system application and application foundation, as well as extracting business logic into add-on and localization apps. As we go, we’ll publish the source code for the modules and apps in this repo. The modules and apps are open for contributions. The apps can furthermore serve as starting point for verticalizations or just as samples for developing apps.

Microsoft will ship the contributions in upcoming releases of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, where you’ll get to enjoy the effect of your contributions.

### **[BCTech](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech)**
In the Business Central development team, we are passionate about technology. If you are a Business Central developer or simply a BC tech enthusiast and you share the same passion, this repo is for you. In the R&D team, we work hard for each release to implement new features to make this product great, but if you are a developer, you know that there are a lot of other things happening in the process. We do prototypes, investigate new technologies, set some intricate experiments to test performance, try out new processes and more. Most of this work never makes it out of the four walls of Microsoft and we realized that some of it might be of value to you, the members of the tech community. So instead of keeping all this good stuff for ourselves, we have decided to share. Don't hesitat to provide feedback, comments and opinions but also let us know what you want to hear about.
